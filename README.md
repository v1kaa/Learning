This folder contains my learning projects as I explore ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. These are simple applications and code snippets that I create while studying and practicing web development. Each project focuses on different aspects of building web applications, such as CRUD operations, database integration (both SQL Server and in-memory databases), and using Entity Framework Core for data management. This folder serves as a collection of my progress and experiments as I continue to develop my skills in backend development
